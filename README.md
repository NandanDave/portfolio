# 🕹️ Interactive Portfolio Game – Game Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive portfolio built entirely in **Unity 2D**!  
Instead of a traditional list of projects, this portfolio lets you explore and interact with some of my work through a **2D platformer game**.

## 🎮 How to Play
- **Move** – `W` `A` `S` `D`
- **Jump** – `Spacebar`
- **Attack** – `J`
- **Sprint** – `Left Shift`
- **Interact with Doors / Projects** – `E`

You control a player character who can explore the scene, interact with a door, and view my projects dynamically through an in-game interface.

## 🚪 Project Interaction
- Move your character near a **door**.
- A **project selection dropdown** will appear.
- Select a project from the list.
- Press **`E`** to view details or launch the project.




## 📂 Built With
